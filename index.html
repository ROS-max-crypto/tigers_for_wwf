<h2>Facts</h2>
<h4 class="facts">The tiger is the biggest species of the cat family.
     Tigers can reach a length of up to 3.3 metres (11 feet) and weigh as much as 300 kilograms (660 pounds)
     Tigers are easily recognizable with their dark vertical stripes and reddish/orange fur.
 The Bengal tiger is the most common tiger.
 Tigers live between 20-26 years in the wild.
 Adult tigers generally live alone.
 Unlike most other cats, tigers are great swimmers and actually like the water.
 Tigers are strong, powerful and are known for being one of nature's most feared predators. 
 Their beautiful orange and black striped coats provide camouflage when hunting prey at night.
 Tigers are naturally afraid of fire but they're still forced to jump through rings of fire in circus shows! 
 This means that they're more afraid of being punished by their trainers than they are of the flames.
 Madhya Pradesh is known as the tiger state of india becuase it holds 19% of indias tiger population and 10% of the world's.

    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <h4 CLASS="diet">Tigers are carnivores and will eat most any animal it can catch. 
        This includes some larger mammals such as water buffalo, deer, and wild boar. 
        Tigers sneak up on their prey and then capture them with bursts of speed up to 40 miles per hour.</h4>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <h4 class="habitat">
            Tigers are found in amazingly diverse habitats: rain forests, grasslands, savannas and even mangrove swamps. 
            Unfortunately, 93% of historical tiger lands have disappeared primarily because of expanding human activity.

        <h4 class="numbers">
            As you can see, the population of tigers in India is increasing gradually. 
            If we keep up the pace we might be able to save tigers from extinction.

        <h4 class="pastime">Turns out without people involved, a tiger will typically hunt during the day.
            They're otherwise ambush predators, though in a more active way than animals that'll just sit and wait. 
            A tiger on the prowl will stalk prey until they can sprint up to them and just take them down with their size alone.</h4>
